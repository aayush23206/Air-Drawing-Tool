HAND DETECTION ALGORITHM:
  1. Capture video frame
  2. Convert BGR → HSV color space
  3. Apply adaptive skin tone thresholding
  4. Morphological operations (erosion/dilation)
  5. Extract hand contour (largest connected area)
  6. Calculate contour moments for center position
  7. Find convex hull and extract finger tips
  8. Estimate extended finger count

DRAWING PIPELINE:
  1. Detect hand and count extended fingers
  2. If index=1, enter drawing mode
  3. Get finger tip coordinates
  4. Interpolate smooth line between recent points
  5. Render using OpenCV circle and line functions
  6. Blend canvas with semi-transparent overlay (60% canvas, 40% camera)
  7. Display on screen
